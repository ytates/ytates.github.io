<p>In this case study from Data Analytics Accelerator, I was prompted to analyze the State of Massachusetts education data. The main focuses were:
What schools are struggling the most?
How does class size affect college admission?
What are the top math schools in the state?</p>

<h5 id="unlocking-the-potential-massachusetts-mission-to-analyze-education-data-to-improve-its-school-system">Unlocking the Potential: Massachusetts’ Mission to Analyze Education Data to Improve its School System</h5>

<p>As a data analyst, I’m always excited to take on new challenges and explore ways to present complex information in an easily understandable way. Recently, I worked on a data project analyzing the State of Massachusetts education data. I chose the Massachusetts school system because they are always at the forefront of education in their public schools. With a focus on student success and equity, I sought to discover how the school system could use data to improve key critical areas.</p>
