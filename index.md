#### [Education Project](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/massachusetts-education-analysis-samantha-paul/)
In this case study from Data Analytics Accelerator, I was prompted to analyze the State of Massachusetts education data. The main focuses were:
What schools are struggling the most?
How does class size affect college admission?
What are the top math schools in the state?

##### Unlocking the Potential: Massachusettsâ€™ Mission to Analyze Education Data to Improve its School System

As a data analyst, I'm always excited to take on new challenges and explore ways to present complex information in an easily understandable way. Recently, I worked on a data project analyzing the State of Massachusetts education data. I chose the Massachusetts school system because they are always at the forefront of education in their public schools. With a focus on student success and equity, I sought to discover how the school system could use data to improve key critical areas.
